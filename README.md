### Jets Project

#### Description:
This is a program allows a user to manage the fleet of aircraft for "Air Force Reserve Command".

#### Instructions:
- Run the program.
- Select an option from the presented menu:
1. This will display a list of all aircraft that are currently in the fleet and their corresponding statistics.
2. This will make every aircraft currently in the fleet "fly". This will display each aircraft's information, as well as the aircraft's endurance based on fuel burn at max forward speed.
3. This will display the fastest aircraft currently in the fleet.
4. This will display the aircraft in the fleet with the longest range.
5. This will "load the cargo" for all Cargo Jets in the fleet.
6. This will allow the user to select a specific jet from the fleet to "fly". This presents the user with various sub-menus and different actions to choose from depending on the aircraft selected.
7. This will allow the user to add an aircraft to the fleet. Users can select to add a custom aircraft, a custom aircraft of a specific type (e.g. Fighter Jet, Bomber, etc.), or select from preset options based on Air Force Reserve aircraft.
8. This will present a list of the current aircraft in the fleet, and allows the user to remove any aircraft of their choosing.
9. This quits the program.

#### Lessons Learned:
- Scope creep is a challenge. I got a bit ambitious because I wanted a robust application that also had a quality UI in the terminal. This ended up taking quite a bit more time than I intended and I was unable to get to other features that I would have liked to implement such as error prevention through logic and Try/Catch blocks, and more advanced behavioral actions in the aircraft menus. I also would have liked to refactor some of my code for brevity and efficiency, but once again it would have taken too much time.
- At one point I thought I was having issues with my scanner. It turns out that Eclipse was just getting hung up. Clearing the computer's memory took care of this issue.
